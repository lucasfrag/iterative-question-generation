# 🧠 Iterative Question Generation for Fact-Checking

This repository contains the implementation of the experiments from the paper:

**"Less is More: Improved Fact-Checking on AVeriTeC with Iterative Question Generation"**

The project investigates the isolated impact of **iterative question generation** in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for fact-checking.

---

## 📌 Overview

This system follows a standard open-domain fact-checking pipeline:

1. Receive a claim
2. Generate verification questions
3. Use questions as search queries
4. Retrieve evidence from the web
5. Rank and aggregate evidence
6. Predict a final label:
   - `SUPPORTED`
   - `REFUTED`
   - `NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE (NEI)`
   - `CONFLICTING EVIDENCE/CHERRYPICKING`

The key contribution is a controlled comparison between:

- **Single-step question generation**
- **Iterative question generation**

---

## ⚙️ Methods

### 🔹 Single-step
- Generates up to **5 questions in a single pass**
- No access to intermediate evidence
- All queries are independent

```
prompt = f"""
You are a fact-checking assistant.

Task: Generate up to {num_questions} questions to verify the claim.

Claim:
{context.claim}

Claim date:
{context.claim_date}

Speaker:
{context.speaker}

Instructions:
- Generate as many useful questions as needed (from 1 up to {num_questions})
- Do not force unnecessary questions
- Avoid redundancy
- Questions must be factual and verifiable
- If claim involves time, check chronology
- If claim involves attribution, verify speaker/source
- If claim involves numbers, verify quantities
- Do not provide explanations

Output:
Return a numbered list of questions only.
"""
```

### 🔹 Iterative
- Generates **one question at a time**
- Each question is conditioned on:
  - previously generated questions
  - previously retrieved evidence
- Stops early if enough evidence is gathered

```
prompt = f"""
Task: Generate ONE new question to help verify the claim.

Claim:
{context.claim}

Claim date:
{context.claim_date}

Speaker:
{context.speaker}

---

Previous questions:
{previous_questions}

---

Known evidence (partial):
{evidence_snippets}

---

Current stance signals:
{stance_summary}

---

Instructions:
- Generate ONLY ONE question
- Do NOT repeat previous questions
- Focus on missing or uncertain aspects
- Do not force unnecessary questions
- Avoid redundancy
- Questions must be factual and verifiable
- If claim involves time, check chronology
- If claim involves attribution, verify speaker/source
- If claim involves numbers, verify quantities
- Do not provide explanations

Output:
Provide only the question.
"""
```

👉 The only difference between methods is **how questions are generated**

venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

---

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration (.env)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# ===== LLM =====
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b # Local model served via Ollama
LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.0      # Set to `0.0` for deterministic outputs
LANGUAGE=en              # Language used in prompts (default: `en`)

# ===== QUESTION GENERATION =====
MAX_QUESTIONS=5          # Maximum number of generated questions (N = 5)

# ===== SEARCH ENGINE =====
SEARCH_ENGINE=duckduckgo
SEARCH_MAX_RESULTS=10   # Number of results per query
SEARCH_MAX_URLS=30      # Maximum URLs retrieved per query
SEARCH_MAX_WORKERS=10   # Parallel workers for retrieval

# ===== RETRIEVAL =====
BM25_TOP_K=10           # Number of documents selected via BM25
USE_QUESTION_FOR_RETRIEVAL=true

# ===== RERANKING =====
RERANKER_MODEL=cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2   # Cross-encoder model for reranking
RERANKER_TOP_K=5        # Final number of selected passages
RERANKER_THRESHOLD=0.3  # Score threshold for filtering
USE_RERANKER=true       # Enable/disable reranking stage

# ===== PASSAGES =====
CHUNK_SIZE=300          # Number of tokens per passage chunk
```

## ▶️ Running Experiments

### 🔹 Single-step

```bash
python experiments/run_averitec_original.py
```

---

### 🔹 Iterative

```bash
python experiments/run_averitec_iterative.py
```

---

## 📊 Outputs

Results are saved in:

```
outputs/
```

Includes:

- Predictions per claim
- Aggregated metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Macro-F1
  - F1 per class
  - Number of queries
  - Token usage

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Iterative generation:
  - Improves accuracy (+1.7 to +17.5)
  - Reduces number of queries (~50%)
  - Reduces abstention (NEI)
  - Increases token usage (7–17%)

👉 Key insight: **Iterative generation shifts computation from retrieval to reasoning**

---

## 🧪 Dataset

- **AVeriTeC (development set)**
- 500 real-world claims
- Open-domain (web retrieval)

Labels:

- `SUPPORTED`
- `REFUTED`
- `NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE`
- `CONFLICTING EVIDENCE/CHERRYPICKING`
